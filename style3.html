		<h2>The Movement:</h2>
		<p>The Black Panthers Party was a far-left politcal movement and party that promoted communism, black power and gender equality, and fought capitalism and war. They were figureheads of the Black Power and Civil Rights Movement. The BPP was a part of a new intellectual leftist branch of political ideaology, and they became the embodiment of cool resistance. "Black is beautiful" was a popular slogan.  </p>

		<h2>The Meaning:</h2>
<p> The look of the Black Panther Party has become an icon for 70s culture as well as protest fashion. The black leather was not only a functional choice but a sophisitcated one. The large black sunglasses were used to obscure faces to protect Panthers and their families. Most had afros, a popular hair style of the time, especially for those with natural hair, as the afro embraced untouched black hair and black identity. Finally, the iconic black beret is a nod to the military's green berets, juxtaposing ideaologies and beliefs.   </p>
