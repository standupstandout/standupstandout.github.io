		<h2>The Movement:</h2>
		<p>Three years after the Brown vs. Board of Education desegregation decision, America was still not integrated and black citizens still did not have the right to vote. In order to bring attention  to this issue and promote equality, leaders of the future civil rights movement, including Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,  organized a march on Washington on June 3, 1957.</p>

		<h2>The Meaning:</h2>
<p>The prayer pilgramage was just that: a journey of moral and spiritual significance, a truly religious event. As such, the attire was Sunday Best. Pilgrims wore their very nicest clothes, as they were marching before the nation and before God. The photos from the protest are full of dresses, jackets and elegant hats, giving a digified nature to the marchers. The power of the style in this protest lies in optics. Protesters are seen as good Christians, but also as respectable citizens taking part in a civil, peaceful protest. The potrait of people who defy society is often a cynical one, making protesters into dangerous, destructive and malicious beings. The pilgrims at the 1957 Prayer Pilgramage for Freedom embodied the seriousness and dignity of their movement through their attire, and the importance of this echoes through history.    </p>
