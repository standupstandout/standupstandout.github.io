		<h2>The Moment:</h2>

		<h2>The Movement:</h2>
		<p>In the 1960s and 70s, many Americans opposed U.S. involvment in the war in Vietnam. Protesters fought the draft, the attacks on Communism, the excessive violence, the media coverage of the war and the lack of free speech. This movement was one of previously unprecedented student activism and support, partnering with the free speech movement and civil rights movement. Common slogans include "Make love, not war", "Hey, Hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?" and "Peace Now!". </p>

		<h2>The Meaning:</h2>
<p>Protesting the war was not just done by hippies and stoners, but average people who believed in non-violence. At a time when women's fashion was being revolutionized and flower power was dominating youth culture, the loose, free iconic style of the 60s became synonmous with peace and non-violence protest. </p>
